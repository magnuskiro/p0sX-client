# Contributing

## How to contribute
1. Read the guidelines for Contributing
2. Branch out or fork
3. Code
4. Pull request
5. Wait for merge

## Conventions

### Branch naming
Branches should be named accuratly and follow the following convention:

(feature|bug)-description-owner

Example: feature-imagegallery-kradalby

### Commit messages
Commit messages should be descriptive and accuratly describe the changes done.

### Code style
All code should be compatible with _at least_ the latest NodeJS version.

The code must be linted with ESLint, the rules can be found [here](https://github.com/nuxis/p0sX-client/blob/master/.eslintrc).

Before a pull request, the code should not contain any error or warnings from the linter.

## Merge approval

Rules:

1. You _cannot_ merge your own pull request
2. Currently only [Maintainers](https://github.com/nuxis/p0sX-client/blob/master/MAINTAINERS) can merge pull requests.
